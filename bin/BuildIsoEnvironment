 GoboLinux LiveCD Building Environment
 --------------------------------------
 André Detsch - Last Updated 14/02/2006
==============================================================================

This is a simple environment on which someone can easily customize gobolinux
live/installation CD (012 or above).

The process is really easy, and has evolved through the lasts releases.

==============================================================================
 Performing basic changes on the GoboLinux LiveCD
==============================================================================

Package needed: SquashFS-Tools 2.0
                A squashfs enabled kernel

=> Phase 1 - Chroot into copied system:
There is a convenience script that binds /dev and /proc,
calls chroot and do some other simple tasks. All you have to do is run
  ChrootEnvironment

Since 012alpha1 (when we started to use squashfs), you can perform changes
directly in the "Environment" directory without having to call this script
(in this case, jump to Phase 4). By the way, chrooting into the Enviroment
directory enables you to use the management scripts (InstallPackage, RemoveProgram, etc.)
and even the "Manager" front-end.

=> Phase 2 - Perform the changes:
Do whatever you what inside the chroot environment...

=> Phase 3 - Exit the chrooted environment:
Just call
  "exit" or "^d"
The "ChrootEnvironment" script will do the rest, including unbinding everything

=> Phase 4 - Make sane checks on the environment before creating the ISO
call
  PerformLastSteps
The script will check for dependencies and warn you on any problems.

=> Phase 5 - Building the new ISO
call
  CompressAndBuildISO
as the name sugests, it will do two things:
- create an squashfs file (inside LiveCD)
- build an BuiltISO/GoboLinux-NoVersion.iso iso file.

Thats it!

==============================================================================
 Advanced features:
==============================================================================

=> Changing the kernel: to change the kernel to be used in LiveCD, you must
udpate the kernel image at LiveCD/isolinux/kernel;


==============================================================================
About the directories:
==============================================================================

- BuiltISO -> will contain the new generated iso

- Mount_CDROM -> A convenience directory. The "ChrootEnvironment" script
binds it with /Mount/CD-ROM inside Environment, i.e., on the chrooted
environment, you can access it via /Mount/CD-ROM, using it as a directory
to place or get files easily from outside the chrooted environment.

- Environment -> Contains files extracted from LiveCD squashfs.

- LiveCD -> cointains the things needed to build the LveCD (squashfs file
and isolinux directory)

Tip: if you dont have enough free space in one partition, you can create symlinks
(e.g. ${DIR}BuiltISO -> /Depot/BuiltISO), so you dont have to edit the scripts.
