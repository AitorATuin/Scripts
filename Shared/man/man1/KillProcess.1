.SH SYNOPSIS
.B KillProcess
\fI{ -c | -m | \fR[\fI-n\fR] \fI<regexps\fR...\fI> }\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Enhanced process killing utility.
.SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Show this help.
.HP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Show program version.
.HP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.IP
Enable verbose mode.
.HP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR
.IP
Ask for confirmation before killing a process.
.HP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-display\fR
.IP
Informative output only. Do not actually kill any process.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-name\fR
.IP
Kill processes by name. This is similar to killall, but names are matched to regular expressions passed as additional parameters to KillProcess. This is the default behavior
if no other mode switches are passed.
.HP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-memory\fR
.IP
Kill the process that is consuming the greatest amount of memory.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-cpu\fR
.IP
Kill the process with the highest CPU usage level.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-spare\fR <entry>[:<entry>...]
.IP
Enter a colon\-separated list of program names that should not be killed by automatic kills. Entries for this list can also be added in the killProcessSpare entry in the
configuration file.
.SS "Notes:"
.IP
Be mindful that when matching processes by name, you are actually searching for a match in any part of the entire process command line. For example, entering 'ion' as a pattern
would also match 'evolution'. Furthermore, even parameters may match: a search for 'lpd' would also kill 'kwrite helpdocument.txt'.
