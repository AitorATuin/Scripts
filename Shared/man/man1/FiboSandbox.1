Notes:
.PP
To allow mobility within the sandbox, the '.' directory is mounted at
a sandbox root (like /System/Variable/tmp/.FiboSandbox4146). For this reason, use of relative paths like '..' to reach
directories higher in the hierarchy than '.' may produce unexpected results.
It may also confuse symbolic links that flow through the sandbox.
